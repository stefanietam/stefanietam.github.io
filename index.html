                HONG KONG HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF GLOBAL NEWS BUT PROBABLY NOT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. <br/>
                <br/>
                FOR MOST OF 2019, LARGE-SCALE PROTESTS PARALYZED THE CITY FOR WHAT FELT LIKE OUR NEW NORMAL. THEN CAME COVID-19 AND THE CITY FELL INTO THE CHAOS OF A FACELESS ASSAILANT. TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD HONG KONG MAY SEEM BROKEN AND DIVIDED - A CITY AT ODDS WITH ITSELF. WHAT PEOPLE CAN’T SEE, DESPITE THE PANDEMIC AND POLITICAL DRAMA, IS THAT WE’RE STILL A VIBRANT, THRIVING CULTURAL PLAYGROUND. INSPIRED AND DRIVEN BY WHAT’S HAPPENING AROUND THEM, ARTISTS ARE CONTINUOUSLY CREATING WORKS THAT KEEP THE SPIRIT OF HONG KONG VERY MUCH ALIVE.<br/>
                <br/>
                THAT WAS THE CATALYST FOR YEP YEP. PART FASHION, PART ART MAGAZINE, WE’VE CREATED A TRULY UNIQUE PUBLICATION DURING THESE INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TIMES. IT FEATURES SOME OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND EXPERIMENTAL HONG KONG CREATORS EITHER BASED HERE OR ABROAD. EACH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISUALLY EXPLORE THE CONCEPT OF IDENTITY IN RELATION TO HONG KONG.<br/>
                <br/>
                YEP YEP IS NOT JUST A TRIBUTE TO HONG KONG. IT’S A TANGIBLE PLATFORM FOR PEOPLE TO COLLABORATE, CREATE, EXPERIMENT, AND MAKE ART. WE HOPE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AT OUR MOST SEPARATED, WITH THE PROMISE THAT OUR VOICES WILL BE BROADCAST TO THE WORLD.<br/>
                <br/>
                WE HOPE YOU ENJOY WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY AND SHOW. THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING YEP YEP’S FIRST ISSUE.
